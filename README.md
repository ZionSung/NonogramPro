# NonogramPro
Key Words: NP-complete, CSP, logic ad-hoc heuristics, combinatorial ad-hoc heuristics, AI, backtracking

My college(NTCU in Taiwan Taichung) graduate project.
Still Working Now

### Abstract
This code is for our research on solving Nonogram's Problems in more efficient way.

There are two main ways to solve the problem, which is logic-based another is combinatorial. We want to know that wheather there is the fastest or best way to solve Nonogram's Problems.

### Competition
We have won the championship in TCGA2020 !!! ( Of course, the code, NonogramPro, is not the competition code, this code is for our research )
